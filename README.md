# I have created this project with React at F.E and Nodejs at B.E on local machine

    NOTE 1: I haven't deployed the code in the server so please run at local machine
    NOTE 2: DO npm install in parent directory and then go to cd client and do npm install
          if package.json nodemodules is not shared  

    1) how to run Project: 
        a) Go to the project and move to cd client, then run npm start in vs code
        b) and open a new terminal to run backend , to run it go to the project parent directory and use nodemon server

    4) Searching by phone and name ![](SearchingByPhoneName.png)
        - Please in the name part please give one space between the name like Abhijeet Rajak. I know this is a logical bug but it can be removed By using two text field 
        first name and last name.I am not altering the logic so that time donot get wasted
        

        Thank U for the oppurtunity
